#Access token validation endpoint

#####As of version 2.2, the access token validation endpoint has been deprecated and replaced with the [Token Introspection](https://identityserver.github.io/Documentation/docsv2/endpoints/introspection.html) endpoint.

For versions 2.0 and 2.1, the access token validation endpoint can be used to validate reference tokens. 
It can be also used to validate self-contained JWTs if the consumer does not have support for appropriate JWT or cryptographic libraries.

You can either GET or POST to the validation endpoint. Due to query string size restrictions, POST is recommended.

### Example

```
POST /connect/accesstokenvalidation

token=<token>
```

or

```
GET /connect/accesstokenvalidation?token=<token>
```

A successful response will return a status code of 200 and the associated claims for the token. An unsuccessful response will return a 400 with an error message.

It is also possible to pass a scope that is expected to be inside the token:

```
POST /connect/accesstokenvalidation

token=<token>&
expectedScope=calendar
```

**Remark** The access token validation endpoint does not enforce client authentication. 
Don't use reference tokens for confidentiality purposes!
